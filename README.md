# menuman  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dailybacon/menuman.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dailybacon/menuman)
This is a menu app designed to resemble JustEat or any of the other food ordering services found around the web.  Admins should be able to create menus, each with their own sections, which in turn have their own items. Users will eventually be able to create orders using the service, but it's implementation is not yet final.
